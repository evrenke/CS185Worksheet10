The goal of this assignment was to compare the runtimes of a python script and a bash script against each other.

I ran 5 cases of both the phyton script numbers.py
and my bash version of script numbers.sh.
This was there is more accounting for the unpredictable nature of the OS over the process.

Both scripts had an unusually long outlier, possibly due to server-side slowdown.
For the python script:
Average of all: 46.6976 seconds
Average without outlier: 25.02875 seconds

For the bash script:
Average of all: 31.1638 seconds
Average without outlier: 25.29925 seconds
